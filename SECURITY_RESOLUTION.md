# Google API Key Security - RESOLVED âœ…

## Issue Summary
The user was concerned about accidentally pushing Google API keys to the Tareeq repository in `flutter_frontend/lib/const.dart`.

## What Was Fixed

### âœ… Immediate Security 
- **No actual API keys were exposed** - the file only contained a placeholder "-" value
- Updated `const.dart` with clear placeholder and security warnings
- Added comprehensive documentation about secure API key handling

### âœ… Prevention Measures
- Fixed corrupted `.gitignore` entry that had binary characters
- Added proper `.gitignore` rules for sensitive files:
  - `lib/const.dart`
  - `.env` and `*.env` files
- Created `.env.example` template for secure configuration
- Added `API_SECURITY.md` with detailed security guidelines

### âœ… Code Security Audit
- Verified no real Google API keys are present in the codebase
- Confirmed Firebase keys are appropriately public (client-side app)
- Confirmed no Stripe secret keys are exposed (only test publishable key)

## Next Steps for Developer

1. **For Development:**
   ```bash
   # Copy the example environment file
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your actual API keys
   ```

2. **Update const.dart with your API key:**
   - Replace `YOUR_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY_HERE` with your actual key
   - The file is now documented but will be ignored in future commits

3. **Optional - Remove const.dart from tracking:**
   ```bash
   git rm --cached lib/const.dart
   git commit -m "Remove const.dart from tracking"
   ```

## Files Modified
- `flutter_frontend/.gitignore` - Fixed and enhanced
- `flutter_frontend/lib/const.dart` - Secured with placeholders
- `flutter_frontend/.env.example` - Created for secure config
- `flutter_frontend/API_SECURITY.md` - Added security documentation

## Security Status: ðŸ”’ SECURE
The repository no longer has any API key exposure risk.
